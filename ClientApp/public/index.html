      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.
      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        How React builds the page (Use the first commit in which this description is present, as future commits may change line numbers):
        1) Index.js runs and identifies "rootElement" as the element with the ID 'root' (Line 11).
        2) Index.js uses ReactDOM to render our React App in the "rootElement" div (Lines 13-17).
        3) Index.js' JSX contains the "<App />" component, which is imported on line 7, and is a reference to the App.js file.
        4) App.js' <App /> component will be rendered, which contains a <Layout /> component (Lines 17-22), which is imported on line 5, and is a reference to the components/Layout.js file. It uses the <Route /> component from React Router to associate components with URL paths.
        5) components/Layout.js' <Layout /> component will be rendered, which contains references to the layout's children (Line 14). This is a reference to the associated React Router component declared in <App />. This causes the child components to be rendered based on the path using Router. It also contains a reference to <NavMenu />, which is imported on Line 3, and is a reference to the components/NavMenu.js file.
        6) <NavMenu /> gets rendered, which contains the links to the React Router URL paths. It contains CSS to deal with mobile devices.
        7) The child with the path matching the URL gets rendered in place of {this.props.children} in <Layout /> which could be <Home />, <Counter /> or <FetchData />.
